# BST 270 Project: Scrabble Scores

In this project, we attempt to reproduce the figures featured in the 2017 538 article ["How 'Qi' and 'Za' Changed Scrabble."](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-qi-and-za-changed-scrabble/) Our analysis can be run in the notebook `scrabble_analysis.Rmd`. The notebook is also available as an html file in `scrabble_analysis.html` and as a pdf file in `scrabble_analysis.pdf`. Data used in the notebook can be accessed in the following 538 repository: <https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/scrabble-games>.

While our figures resemble those presented in the article, I would not consider the article to be completely reproducible. For example, while our plotted distributions of winning and losing Scrabble scores generally match the shapes of the distributions in the article, it appears that the peak of our distribution of losing scores is shorter than the corresponding peak in the article. Because the author of the article does not describe how they processed the data or set the distribution plot bin widths, we cannot say for sure how the discrepancies arose. Likewise, our plot of the weekly average scores before and after the addition of around 11,000 words to the Scrabble dictionary in March 2006 does not appear to capture the increase in scores found in the corresponding plot in the article, particularly in the fitted linear models. It is hard to say whether this discrepancy is due to how we processed the data or how we conducted the analysis with the linear models.
